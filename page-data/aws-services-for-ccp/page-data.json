You may have a hard time remembering which task is performed by which service. </p>\n<p>This post will hopefully shed some light for you, as I've created a mind map to list the services you should know about for the\nfoundational exam. As you may know, at this level the exam expects you to know these services at high-level, and have some idea about how to use\nthem for various scenarios.</p>\n<h3>Why Amazon EC2 but AWS Lambda?</h3>\n<p>When looking through the list of AWS services, you may have noticed that some are prefixed with <code class=\"language-text\">AWS</code> and some with <code class=\"language-text\">Amazon</code>.</p>\n<p>Usually, <code class=\"language-text\">Amazon</code> is used for standalone products that can be used as they are.\n<code class=\"language-text\">AWS</code> is used for utility services that are typically used with other services or products.\nHowever, it's worthwhile to remember that some products don't strictly follow this convention.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 06, 2022","path":"/aws-services-for-ccp","title":"AWS services you should know about for Cloud Practitioner Exam","tags":["AWS","Certification","CCP"]}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
