In the videos, he describes an interesting idea of using 66 days to build the habit of learning data science. </p>\n<p>The key point is to learn at least for 5 minutes, everyday. Because it takes about 66 days to form a new habit.</p>\n<p>So I thought of giving this a try, in the hope that it would give some structure to my learning process. I would keep record of each day\nhere in my blog, so that I'm accountable for keeping track and motivated to stick to the process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103699/132438791-a293e29b-ceb2-4336-b185-3a59de35d627.jpg\" alt=\"danielle-macinnes-IuLgi9PWETU-unsplash\"></p>\n<h6><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dsmacinnes?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Danielle MacInnes</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/just-start?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></em></h6>\n<p>Although I'm close to the end of my masters degree, I feel like there's a lot more to learn about actually\napplying data science. So I thought a good place to start would be to recap some maths and Python.</p>\n<p>Recently, I realised that knowing the sort of matrix and vector calculations that happen behind the scenes is useful\nto understand even the most basic linear regression model. With all the toolboxes and frameworks we have, it's easy to\nnot worry about what actually happens in the algorithms. However, when things go wrong in real life, knowing the math\nbehind those code lines would help in heaps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/articles/writing-about-math-for-the-perplexed-and-the-traumatized-pdf\">Steven Strogatz</a>\nhas actually said that math is linked with fear in our brains.

This set of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN\">videos\nby Andrew Ng</a> (from Lecture 3.1 to 3.6) gives a\nquick refresh on the basic concepts you can watch in less than an hour. The notes from the videos are available\non the <a href=\"http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/03_Linear_algebra_review.html\">Stanford Machine Learning course website</a>.\nThe videos are also a part of the Machine Learning course on <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\">Coursera</a>. </p>\n<p>Read more about Day 2 of my 66 Days of Data journey here.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 20, 2021","path":"/66days-day1","title":"66 Days of Data - Day 1","tags":["66 Days of Data","Project"]}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
