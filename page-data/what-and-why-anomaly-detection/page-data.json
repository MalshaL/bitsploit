Anomalies, or outliers, introduced noise into the dataset,\nmaking the training of models a difficult task. </p>\n<p>The spoiled fruit in above example introduce noise into the dataset. Once removed, they are not considered in the study.</p>\n<p>Around the year 2000, researchers started to get interested in anomalies themselves. They recognized that the\npresence of anomalies in a dataset is often related to interesting or suspicious events. Since then, several\ndata mining techniques were developed focusing on detecting anomalies in a dataset. There are various such\napplications where anomaly detection is used to discover hidden occurrences.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-bottom: none\">\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103699/133366601-7a1d272f-189f-48e0-b59a-033265b4c704.png\" alt=\"anom3\"></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-bottom: none\">\n<p><strong>Intrusion Detection</strong> is one of the most well-known applications of anomaly detection.
