Here is the beginner's guide to make your own doodle in Photoshop.</p>\n<p>I've used Photoshop CS5 to carry out the following steps. However, because we use some basic tools from Photoshop,\nthese steps would work in earlier or later versions of Photoshop as well.</p>\n<h3>1. Download Photoshop brushes and install.</h3>\n<p>I have created the doodles using brushes. There is a collection of brushes already shipped with Photoshop. In addition, you\ncan add new brush pallets such as <a href=\"http://www.brusheezy.com/brushes/1374-handmade-doodle-brushes\">this awesome pallet</a>.\nSimply download and install the <strong>.abr</strong> file using the Brushes palette.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103699/132112011-962019cf-f713-403c-925f-acb3dff48b12.png\" alt=\"2\"></p>\n<h3>2. Create your document.</h3>\n<p>Create a new document with a size of your choice and fill in with a color you like.</p>\n<h3>3. Create the doodle using brushes.</h3>\n<p>Select a color to be used for the brushes, preferably a lighter tone than the one used for the background.\nAdjust <strong>Opacity</strong> for the color, a value around 30% should work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103699/132112013-ab4a5794-bd9c-4874-8823-dc3d4a459c1c.png\" alt=\"3\"></p>\n<p>Select a brush you like and adjust the size of the brush if needed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103699/132112059-91dd7c5f-c0a4-4ca3-a170-64815efbcb39.png\" alt=\"4\"></p>\n<p>Stamp and create your doodle.</p>\n<p>And there's your own doodle background!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103699/132111988-a4ea6a7e-4764-4b5d-bd81-4b7ccbf39a01.png\" alt=\"intro_img\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 05, 2015","path":"/doodle-background-in-photoshop","title":"Create a Doodle Background in Photoshop","tags":["Photoshop","How to"]}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
