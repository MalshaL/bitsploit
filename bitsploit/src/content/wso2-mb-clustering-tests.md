A cluster is a group of nodes each running an instance of a product. This cluster of nodes act as a single instance, 
dividing up the work among the nodes, improving performance and reliability.

In this post, let us setup a cluster of two nodes running WSO2 Message Broker 3.0.0 and run clustering tests on them. 
These steps can be used to set up a cluster of [MB 3.2.0](https://docs.wso2.com/display/MB320/Clustered+Deployment) as well.

You can get the WSO2 Message Broker installer from [here](https://wso2.com/products/message-broker/). However, to run 
the tests, you will need to checkout the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wso2-attic/product-mb). You will 
require at least two instances running MB to create a cluster with two nodes. You can use one of these MB nodes 
to run the test case suite.

### Setting up the MB cluster

Following configurations need to be done in all nodes in the cluster.

#### 1. Configuring broker.xml

Configure the `<MB_HOME>/repository/conf/broker.xml` file as described in steps 2 and 3 in WSO2 documentation [here](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER44x/Configuring+the+Broker+Nodes).

When modifying the thrift related configurations in each node, use the IP of the node as the `thriftServerHost`:

```xml
<coordination>
    <nodeID>default</nodeID>
    <thriftServerHost>x.x.x.x</thriftServerHost>
    <thriftServerPort>7611</thriftServerPort>
</coordination>
```

#### 2. Creating the message store for the cluster

Create the MySql database to be used as the message store for MB. Although MB supports various database systems 
such as MySql, MSSQL, and Oracle, currently only MySql databases are supported for cluster testing.

* In one MB node or in a separate remote instance, setup a MySql server. Install MySql using the command below.

```
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

* Create the database to be used as the message store for MB. The database could be named as `wso2_mb`.

* Add the database to the datasources in `<MB_HOME>/repository/conf/datasources/master-datasources.xml` file as 
described in WSO2 documentation [here](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER44x/Configuring+MySQL). For this 
database to be used as the message store of MB, set the datasource name as `WSO2_MB_STORE_DB`, and remove or 
comment out the default H2 datasource in the same name in the config file.

* In `broker.xml`, add the message store and andes context store configs for the MySql database as shown 
[here](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER44x/Configuring+MySQL in step 4. Comment out the similar configs 
for `WSO2_MB_STORE_DB`.

#### 3. Setting up the cluster databases

Every WSO2 product uses a database to store information such as user management and registry data. 
In addition to this database, a cluster should have a central database for config and governance registry mounts. 
You can follow WSO2 documentation [here](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER44x/Setting+up+the+Database) and 
create the required databases. You can create these databases in the server or node in which you created the 
MySql database in the previous step.

#### 4. Configuring registry.xml
Add the details of registry database created in the previous step in the `<MB_HOME> /repository/conf/registry.xml` 
file as mentioned in the [documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CLUSTER44x/Configuring+the+Broker+Nodes#ConfiguringtheBrokerNodes-Configuringregistry.xml).

#### 5. Configure axis2.xml and qpid-config.xml files
Configure `<MB_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml` and `<MB_HOME> /repository/conf/advanced/qpi-config.xml` files 
as mentioned in the documentation.

#### 6. Time sync all broker nodes

Use the following command to time sync the nodes.

```
$ sudo apt-get install ntpdate;
$ sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
```

### Starting the cluster

Now the cluster is configured. Start each node using the following command in `<MB_HOME>/bin`.
To create the required tables in the MySql message store database which we created in step 2, run the starting 
command with the flag `-Dsetup`.

```
./wso2server.sh start -Dsetup
```

After starting all nodes, observe the logs using the command `tailf` command as below, and verify that the 
nodes are added to the cluster and are connected with each other.

```
tailf ../repository/logs/ wso2carbon.log
```

### Running clustering tests

We can use one of the above nodes to run clustering tests. Configure the following in the node you wish 
to run the tests.

1. Add the nodes of the cluster in [`automation.xml`](https://github.com/wso2-attic/product-mb/blob/master/modules/integration/tests-platform/tests-clustering/src/test/resources/automation.xml). 

```xml
<platform>
    <!--
        cluster instance details to be used to platform test execution. 
        One node is to be a compression enabled node, and the other node is to be without compression.
    -->
    <productGroup name="MB_Cluster" clusteringEnabled="false" default="true">
        <instance name="mb002" type="standalone" nonBlockingTransportEnabled="false">
            <hosts>
                <host type="default">192.168.1.3</host>
            </hosts>
            <ports>
                <port type="http">9763</port>
                <port type="https">9443</port>
                <port type="amqp">5672</port>
                <port type="mqtt">1883</port>
            </ports>
            <properties>

            </properties>
        </instance>
        <instance name="mb003" type="standalone" nonBlockingTransportEnabled="false">
            <hosts>
                <host type="default">192.168.1.4</host>
            </hosts>
            <ports>
                <port type="http">9764</port>
                <port type="https">9444</port>
                <port type="amqp">5673</port>
                <port type="mqtt">1884</port>
            </ports>
            <properties>
         
            </properties>
        </instance>
    </productGroup>
</platform>
```

2. Add the MySql message store you created earlier to `automation.xml`.

```xml
<datasources>
    <datasource name="mbCluster">
        <url>jdbc:mysql://localhost/WSO2_MB</url>
        <username>root</username>
        <password>root</password>
        <driverClassName>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driverClassName>
    </datasource>
</datasources>
```

3. Enable running tests by setting the value of `skipPlatformTests` in [`pom.xml`](https://github.com/wso2-attic/product-mb/blob/master/modules/integration/tests-platform/tests-clustering/pom.xml) to `false`.

```xml
<properties>
    <skipPlatformTests>true</skipPlatformTests>
</properties>
```

4. Now run the clustering tests by executing the command `mvn clean install`.
