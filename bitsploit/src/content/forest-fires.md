Forest fires are one of the major natural catastrophes. 

They can endanger both human and wild life. And can severely destruct the environment.

This is why predicting forest fires accurately is important.  

In this project, I used data to explore forest fires that occurred in the Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal. 
My goal was to see how data can be used to predict the amount of danger caused by the fires. 

I used R language for the data analysis. The codebase is shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/MalshaL/forest-fires).

This dataset was collected by the researchers [Cortez and Morais](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/fires.pdf) 
during the time from January 2000 to December 2003. You can find the complete dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning 
Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires).

### Where is Montesinho Natural Park?

Now, you may be interested to know about the park the data is coming from. It's one of the largest natural parks in 
Portugal, with an area of 74,230 hectares.

###### *Location of Montesinho Natural Park*

Montesinho has a diverse natural habitat with 240 species of animals. 
Annual temperature of the park varies from 8 to 12<sup>0</sup>C, although the 
temperature in summer could reach up to 40<sup>0</sup>C.

### About the Dataset

Each row in the dataset is about a fire that had occurred in the park. There are 517 entries, described using 13 variables. 

The image below summarises the 13 variables in the dataset. They are categorised into categorical variables, 
fire weather indexes and weather conditions. The amount of area burnt by fire is used as the target variable.

###### *Figure 1: Variables in the dataset*

The fire weather indexes FFMC, DMC, DC and ISI in the above variables are defined in the Fire Weather Index (FWI). They 
indicate the danger of the fire based on weather conditions. The higher these indexes are, the more dangerous the fire could be. 

FFMC indicates the fuel moisture content in forest litter, while DMC indicates the fuel moisture of decomposed 
organic material. DC determines long-term moisture conditions, and ISI measures the speed of fire spread.

### Problem to solve

The purpose of this project is predicting the burnt area of a fire in Montesinho Park 
based on variables such as location, weather conditions and fire indexes.

### Data Transformations

Before working on any data analysis, the target variable 'burnt area' needed to be transformed. After plotting the target variable, 
we can see that more than 47% of the values are zero (first histogram below). To reduce this skewed distribution, 
I took the logarithmic value (second histogram). As the target variable should be positive (since area should be a 
positive value), the *log(area+1)* transformation was used (third histogram).

### Exploring Data

#### Linear correlation

To start off with, I looked at the linear relationship and correlation among the variables in the dataset. The 
scatter plots below show the distribution of target variable against the 12 independent variables. The plots don't 
show any clear indication of linear relationship among the variables. When examining the Pearson correlation for 
numerical variables, the variable 'DMC' had the highest positive correlation of 0.067 with target variable 'Burnt area', 
which shows very small linear relationship.

###### *Figure 3: Scatter plots of target variable against dependent variables*

Because there is little evidence about any linear correlation among variables, next I looked at the dataset-specific 
aspects. The 4 categorical variablesâ€”x and y coordinates and Month and Day capture geographical 
and temporal information in the dataset. 

#### Fire intensity by location

Therefore, first I used the x and y coordinates to generate a heatmap and identify the areas that were more 
prone to fires. The generated heatmap below show the areas outside the park in green, while the park is in heatmap colours. 
As we can see in the map, most of the heavy fires had been contained in the edges of the park, while the middle of 
the park had faced less severe fires. However, as the leftmost edge of the park has areas with less severe fires 
close to highly burnt areas, we can decide that fires have not spread rapidly across the park.

#### Fire intensity by season

Next, I used the month attribute to find if fires had any seasonal variations. The scatter plot below shows 
occurrence of fires across the four seasons. As expected, we can see that there had been more fires during summer 
and autumn compared to the low frequency of fires in winter and spring. However, it's difficult to identify a clear 
pattern among burnt area and the season, as we can see many fires with an area of zero during summer, while some fires 
in winter have had burnt areas with the values 2 and 4.

### Data Analysis using non-linear regression

Since the dataset didn't show any evident linear correlation, I used non-linear regression with the numerical variables.

To further explore the nature of relationship among variables, I used the pair plot below. 

<img style="max-width: 70%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" 
alt="7" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10103699/153519473-ad1eb487-7a32-46be-bed8-f22f278a62c7.png"/>
###### *Figure 6: Pair plots for numerical variables*

The last row of the above pair plot shows the variation of Area against each predictor variable. We can see that 
Temperature has an evident curve in its graph, indicating a possible non-linear relationship. Similarly, if we 
disregarded the outlier points in the graphs of FFMC and ISI, we can see that majority of data points have a 
curved distribution. Considering these behaviours, I added the variables as polynomial terms to the model 
with an order of 2.

So far we have,

```Area = ... + Temperature^2 + ISI^2 + FFMC^2 + ... ```

Then, I considered the relationships among variables to add the interaction terms to the model. If two predictors 
did not show any evident relationship among each other, they were added as interaction terms to the model.

For instance, Temperature and Wind variables show an equally spread set of points, which does not show a clear 
connection. Therefore, the combination of Temperature and Wind was added to the model as an interaction term. Another 
example is the plot of Wind against ISI, which shows that ISI has a curved relationship with Wind. Therefore, an 
interaction term with a polynomial term was added to the model as ISI<sup>2</sup> * Wind.

After training the model, variables that had a low significance (high P-value) such as `ISI` and `RH` were removed 
to improve the model.

The model became, 
```
Area =  FFMC + DMC + DC + Temperature + Wind + Rain + Temperature^2 + ISI^2 + FFMC^2 + DMC^2 + Wind^2 + DC*ISI + 
        FFMC*ISI + RH*Wind*Rain + Temperature*Wind + Temperature*DMC + ISI2*Wind
```

```shell script
nolin_model1 <- lm(Area ~ .+ I(Temperature^2) + I(ISI^2) + I(FFMC^2) + I(DMC^2) + I(Wind^2) + DC*ISI + RH*Wind*Rain 
                + Temperature*Wind + I(ISI^2)*Wind + FFMC*ISI
                + Temperature*DMC -ISI -RH, data = fire_norm) 

summary(nolin_model1)
```

###### *Figure 7: Summary of initial non-linear model*

This model had a high R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.05345, but the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of the model was 0.01513. The significant gap between 
these values show that the model is not well generalised and may over fit the data. We can see this in the low 
significance of majority of variables in the model.

### Improving the model

Removing variables with high P-values (low significance) helped to improve the significance of the model. The 
resulting model was as follows:

```shell script
Area = FFMC + DC + Temperature + Temperature2 + FFMC2 + Wind2 + DC*ISI + RH*Rain + ISI2*Wind
```

```shell script
# simplified model
nolin_model2 <- lm(Area ~ .+ I(Temperature^2) + I(FFMC^2) 
                + I(Wind^2) + DC*ISI + RH*Rain + I(ISI^2)*Wind
                -ISI -RH -DMC -Rain -Wind, data = fire_norm) 
summary(nolin_model2)
```

###### *Figure 8: Summary of improved non-linear model*

This model gave an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.04602 which was lower than the R<sup>2</sup> from the initial non-linear model of 0.05345. 
However, the improved model had more significant terms, of which Temperature<sup>2</sup> had the highest significance with three stars 
and a P-value of 0.000907. Temperature and DC had high significances with two- and one-star ratings respectively. 
The interaction term RH*Rain had a significance rating of one dot (.), with a P-value of 0.063176. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> was 
0.02709, which gave a reduced difference between the R<sup>2</sup> values. 

To sum up, the implemented model shows that weather conditions such as temperature, rain, relative humidity and Drought 
Code (DC) play an important role in defining the severity of fires. 

To find more interesting effects of each parameter, we can cluster data to find similar data points and build separate 
regression models for each group.
