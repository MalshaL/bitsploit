While going through the #30daysofML track in Kaggle, I stumbled upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I) 
by Ken Jee. In the videos, he describes an interesting idea of using 66 days to build the habit of learning data science. 

The key point is to learn at least for 5 minutes, everyday. Because it takes about 66 days to form a new habit.

So I thought of giving this a try, in the hope that it would give some structure to my learning process. I would keep record of each day 
here in my blog, so that I'm accountable for keeping track and motivated to stick to the process.

Although I'm close to the end of my masters degree, I feel like there's a lot more to learn about actually 
applying data science. So I thought a good place to start would be to recap some maths and Python.

Recently, I realised that knowing the sort of matrix and vector calculations that happen behind the scenes is useful 
to understand even the most basic linear regression model. With all the toolboxes and frameworks we have, it's easy to 
not worry about what actually happens in the algorithms. However, when things go wrong in real life, knowing the math 
behind those code lines would help in heaps.

[Steven Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/articles/writing-about-math-for-the-perplexed-and-the-traumatized-pdf) 
has actually said that math is linked with fear in our brains. Almost as scary as spiders!
(Got scared while looking at actual spider photos, so here's a cute crochet one.)

On this first day, I went through a quick review of Matrix and Vector calculations in Linear Algebra. This set of [videos 
by Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN) (from Lecture 3.1 to 3.6) gives a 
quick refresh on the basic concepts you can watch in less than an hour. The notes from the videos are available 
on the [Stanford Machine Learning course website](http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/03_Linear_algebra_review.html). 
The videos are also a part of the Machine Learning course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
