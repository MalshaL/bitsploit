'The Sun Warriors' is a web based tank game application implemented by [Achini Herath](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/achiniherath) and me. The game can 
accommodate up to five players in a round, competing against each other for life & coins. The game had a 
multiplayer mode and an AI mode. Along with the game, we developed a website featuring information about the game. 
The project incorporated the technologies C#.NET, PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Adobe Photoshop.
