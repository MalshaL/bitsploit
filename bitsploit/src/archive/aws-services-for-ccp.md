###### *A few of the many AWS products and services*

If you're preparing for AWS Cloud Practitioner exam as a beginner to AWS, chances are you're getting somewhat confused and overwhelmed 
with the many services and products offered by AWS. You may have a hard time remembering which task is performed by which service. 

This post will hopefully shed some light for you, as I've created a mind map to list the services you should know about for the 
foundational exam. As you may know, at this level the exam expects you to know these services at high-level, and have some idea about how to use 
them for various scenarios.

### Why Amazon EC2 but AWS Lambda?

When looking through the list of AWS services, you may have noticed that some are prefixed with `AWS` and some with `Amazon`.

Usually, `Amazon` is used for standalone products that can be used as they are. 
`AWS` is used for utility services that are typically used with other services or products. 
However, it's worthwhile to remember that some products don't strictly follow this convention.
